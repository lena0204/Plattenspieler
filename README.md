# Plattenspieler

A music app for Android 5.1 or higher:
- use local music files
- sort by album (only)
- shuffle albums and all songs
- skip to next and previous possible
- show the amount of songs to come in the album
- show stored lyrics
- notification and cover on the lockscreen
- store the playing album to be present when next opening the app
- light and dark design available, plus two colours (pink and teal)

__Known problems__
- Lyrics can't be added, tough possible; storage access is problematic there
- app crashes mostly when changing design

Still under development
