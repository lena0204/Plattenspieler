# Plattenspieler (Gramophone)

A music app for Android 5.1 or higher:

### The usual stuff:
- use local music files
- shuffle albums and all songs
- skip to next and previous possible
- notification and cover on the lockscreen
- persistently save the current playback in case of restarting the phone

### The unusual stuff:
- sort by album (only)
- show the amount of songs to come in the album
- show stored lyrics
- light and dark design available, plus two colours (pink and teal)

__Known problems__
- Lyrics can't be added if songs are saved on external SD-Card; storage access is problematic there
- app crashes mostly when changing design; currently a manual restart is necessary and advised

Still under development
